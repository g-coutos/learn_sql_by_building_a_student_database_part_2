# learn_sql_by_building_a_student_database_part_2

This is one of the required projects to earn the Relational Database course from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/).

In this project I learned more about SQL and how to create a bash script to iterate through a .csv file in order to access the data with queries.
